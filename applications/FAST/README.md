# Fusion model for Atomic and molecular STrcutre (FAST) - LBANN

This is the LBANN implementation of the FAST model using LBANN 

### Prerequisites 

The simulated data does not add additional requirements on top of LBANN and Numpy. 

The pre-processed PDBBind data prequisites are: 

- pyh5 
- pybel 


### Running the models 

Each of the 3DCNN, SGCNN, and FAST models can be run seperately. 

Run the 3DCNN model with:
```
python3 run_3dcnn.py --num-epochs N --mini-batch-size B 
```

Run the 3DCNN model with:
```
python3 run_SGCNN.py --num-epochs N --mini-batch-size B 
```

Run the FAST model with:
```
python3 run_FAST.py --num-epochs N --mini-batch-size B 
```
